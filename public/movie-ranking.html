<h1>Justin's Top 3 Movies</h1>

<h2>These are Justin Joon Kim's top three favorite movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>

<p>
    This is my favorite movie of all time because I am extremely touched by the masterpiece of a story<br />
    that this movie presents.
</p>

<h3>Rush Hour</h3>

<p>
    Absolutely hilarious action movie that was far ahead of its time in content!
</p>

<h3>Stand and Deliver</h3>

<p>
    Stand and Deliver is a bit more of a niche movie to watch.<br />
    The reason why this movie stands in the top 3 above the rest is because of the <br />
    profound message that it sends about hardship, perseverance, and faith.
